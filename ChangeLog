 * Initialized repository, created server.py and README.

2014-01-16  Chris Thomas

 * Added code to server.py to send an HTML response, with DOCTYPE for html5

2014-01-16  Chris Thomas

 * Changed server.py for testability, EOF standardizing
 * Changed test_server.py to expect the kind of response I was sending

2014-01-16  Chris Thomas

 * Changed server.py, adding GET, POST, HEAD functionality, 404s and 405s
 * Added tests to test_server.py for all of the above
 * Made sure my code passed all the tests

2014-01-29  Chris Thomas

 * HW3 branch needs a commit to submit a merge. Here it is.

2014-01-30  Chris Thomas

 * added form and submit, did optimizing, and added new tests

2014-02-04 - 2014-02-14 Chris Thomas

 * HW4 changes
 * Added templating (finally!)
 * Reoptimized request handling and parsing, all parsed into one dict now
   so that's nice.
 * POST now actually works, with both types
 * 404 now has a page
 * 405 handling now follows spec and sends 'Allow: [...]' header
 * optimization of string concats all around
 * PEP8 style conformity now confirmed (yay pylint)
 ** TODO ** add tests for new functionality

2014-02-14 Chris Thomas

 * Updated tests for everything but actually sending multipart POSTs out.
   Still working on figuring that one out.
 * 405 is broken, if I want anything other than 'Allow: GET, HEAD', anyway,
   and for no obvous reason.
 * Calling HW4 done, a week late, with no progress on hw5, and taking time off
   work. Hooray, computer science... >.<

2014-02-14 Chris Thomas

 * Adding hw5 branch, not sure why I don't skip to hw6 at this point...

2014-02-15 Chris Thomas

 * Finished HW5. Only thing not tested if multipart/form-data
   (still don't know how)

2014-02-27 Chris Thomas

 * Starting hw6
 * Added test for multipart/form-data and got it to actually work
 * Added static hosted files directories, and a jpeg and old shell script to
   host, on /image and /file, respectively
 * Added file hosting on /file and /image, hosting the aforementioned files
 * modified tests to accurately test /file (good) and /image (sorta)

2014-03-18 Chris Thomas

 * Started hw7 branch (again, after merging)

2014-03-19 Chris Thomas

  * fixed date on last Changelog
  * cookie passing (server) implemented
  * Added image to imageapp's index

2014-03-20 Chris Thomas

  * more wsgi compliance
  * considered moving app into a proper module structure... maybe later.
  * start hw8
  * add command-line args (optional, with defaults)
  * add twill tests
  * create twill test for myapp

2014-04-02 Chris Thomas

  * package app.py into its own package, to make it easier to write good code
  * documentation, etc.
  * start getting app's imageapp up and running

2014-04-03 Chris Thomas

  * nosetests now work again, they haven't since the wsgi refactor

2014-04-07 Chris Thomas

  * fixed imageshare/image_raw on ref-server, now works on both
  * imageshare/image_view now working (preliminary)

2014-04-12 Chris Thomas

  * finished imageapp replicate -> /imageshare (+5 pts)
  * app now parses wsgi.input itself

  * hw9 go
  * confirmed imageshare supports jpg

2014-04-14 Chris Thomas

  * completed tiff support (uses <embed>)
  * Project for supporting JPEG and TIFF completed (+5 pts)
    * Also supports many other major formats (bmp, gif, png, jpg, tiff)
    * stored the filetype alongside the image data
    * use ajax endpoint to get HMTL code to display the image on-page
      * <embed> for tiff, <img> for everything else
    * jquery used to insert image's code on-page, with <noscript> fallback
      of type <img> with message saying stop being paranoid
  * image uploading unexplicably fixed? Dunno what (specifically) I changed,
    but it works now.
  * Also: TIFF isn't actually supported by any browsers in <img>, so I am using
    AJAX on every page to ask the image module what to use to display the
    image, returning a <embed> tag for tiffs and <img> tags for everything else.
    I talked to you about this, and you said extra project points. (+5 pts)
  * support for .bmp, .gif, tiff, png, jpg confirmed.
  * some sample images provided, not enough for a project point yet, though

2014-04-16 Chris Thomas

  * improved quote list.
  * better quotes app pep8 compliance.
  * quotes app integrated under / for hw9

2014-04-17 Chris Thomas

  * ^ just noticed that's a project (+5 pts)
  * chat app added time display, messages added at end (in chrono order)
  * fixed wsgi.input in environ (server.py)
  * chat app integrated
  * chat and quotes converted to packages
  * trimmed chat and quotes apps (removed extra stuff)
  * hw9 done

  * hw10 go
  * current point total: 20 (10 pts ahead of schedule)
  * favicon serving (tested, working sometimes... hopefully just ff being weird)
  * going for (12) ajax uploading and (16) sqlite persistence (defered to hw11)
2014-04-23 Chris Thomas
  * ajax uploads completed (+5 pts)
    * it will not work in IE9-, but should fallback on form submission OK.
  * hw10 finished (calling it, because I'm 5 pts ahead of schedule still)

  * current point total: 25 (5 pts ahead)
