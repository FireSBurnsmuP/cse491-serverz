 * HW3 branch needs a commit to submit a merge. Here it is.

2014-01-30  Chris Thomas

 * added form and submit, did optimizing, and added new tests

2014-02-04 - 2014-02-14 Chris Thomas

 * HW4 changes
 * Added templating (finally!)
 * Reoptimized request handling and parsing, all parsed into one dict now
   so that's nice.
 * POST now actually works, with both types
 * 404 now has a page
 * 405 handling now follows spec and sends 'Allow: [...]' header
 * optimization of string concats all around
 * PEP8 style conformity now confirmed (yay pylint)
 ** TODO ** add tests for new functionality

2014-02-14

 * Updated tests for everything but actually sending multipart POSTs out.
   Still working on figuring that one out.
 * 405 is broken, if I want anything other than 'Allow: GET, HEAD', anyway,
   and for no obvous reason.
 * Calling HW4 done, a week late, with no progress on hw5, and taking time off
   work. Hooray, computer science... >.<

2014-02-14

 * Adding hw5 branch, not sure why I don't skip to hw6 at this point...

2014-02-15

 * Finished HW5. Only thing not tested if multipart/form-data
   (still don't know how)

2014-02-27

 * Starting hw6
 * Added test for multipart/form-data and got it to actually work
 * Added static hosted files directories, and a jpeg and old shell script to
   host, on /image and /file, respectively
 * Added file hosting on /file and /image, hosting the aforementioned files
 * modified tests to accurately test /file (good) and /image (sorta)
